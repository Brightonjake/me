TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

#Commands:

python week1/exercise1.py
#runs code (not necessary, debugger fixed)

pwd
#shows directory

ls
#lists directory options

python3 ../course/week1/tests.py

#Note: pressing up key scrolls through previous commands. Useful
