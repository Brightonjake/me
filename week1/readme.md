TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

#STATUS UPDATE:
#Debugger in VScode not currently working, run tests in terminal

#Commands:

python week1/exercise1.py
#runs code

pwd
#shows directory

ls
#lists directory options

python3 ../course/week1/tests.py 
#runs tests

#Note: pressing up key scrolls through previous commands. Useful
